Ornela Danushi is a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Pisa. Her studies and research activities focus on Sustainable Software Systems, allowing her to combine her passion for Computer Science with sustainability-related considerations. She is currently investigating the role of software by considering the stakeholders involved, the types of analyses that could be conducted and their rationale, as well as the intended targets of the studied approaches, and which stages of the software lifecycle encounter
sustainability issues more or less frequently. She is particularly interested in sustainability guidelines and software enhancement techniques that can effectively assist her in predicting and achieving this objective in her research field.
She holds a Master of Computer Science degree in Sustainable Software Design and Development from the University of Pisa.
