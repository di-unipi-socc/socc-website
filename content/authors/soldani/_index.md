Jacopo Soldani is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Pisa (Italy). He received the PhD degree in Computer Science in 2017 from the University of Pisa (Italy) with a thesis on "Modelling, analysing and reusing composite cloud applications". His research interests lie in the area of service-based software engineering, including, e.g., cloud-native applications, microservices, and multi-service software architectures. He is also interested in systematic approaches to elicit the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice in software engineering from both white and grey literature. Jacopo has been involved in various research projects on service-based software engineering for cloud- and fog-based applications, he is member of the editorial board of internationally renowned journals, and he has also contributed to the organisation of various editions of international conferences and workshops on software engineering.
