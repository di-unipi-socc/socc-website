title: cloudWatcher
summary: "cloudWatcher aims at monitoring customised health metrics (e.g., the availability of a cloud service and its performance, the status of the network, the performance of a VMâ€™s disk) of multi-Cloud OpenStack systems, by providing configurable alerts associated with such measurements, and it is extensible to accommodate further metrics. Such an objective is pursued through a design that is based on a declarative and modular methodology for monitoring multiple datacentres (DCs)."
