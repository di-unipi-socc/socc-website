abstract: "Smart environments enabled by the Internet of Things aim at improving our daily lives by automatically tuning ambient parameters and by achieving energy savings through self-managing cyber-physical systems. Commercial solutions, however, only permit setting simple target goals on those parameters and do not mediate between conflicting goals among different users and/or system administrators, nor across different IoT verticals. In this article, we propose a declarative approach (and its open-source Prolog prototype) to represent smart environments, user-set goals and customisable mediation policies to reconcile contrasting goals across multiple IoT systems."
