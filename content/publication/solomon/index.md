abstract: "Smart environments powered by the Internet of Things aim at improving our daily lives by automatically tuning ambient parameters (e.g. temperature, interior light) and by achieving energy savings through self-managing cyber-physical systems. Commercial solutions, however, only permit setting simple target goals on those parameters and do not consider mediating conflicting goals among different users and/or system administrators, and feature limited compatibility across different IoT verticals. In this article, we propose a declarative framework to represent smart environments, user-set goals and customisable mediation policies to reconcile contrasting goals encompassing multiple IoT systems. An open-source Prolog prototype of the framework is showcased over two lifelike motivating examples."
