abstract: "Placing FaaS applications onto Fog infrastructures is an open problem presenting various challenges. It requires considering hardware and software requirements of single functions as well as Quality of Service requirements of the overall application. In this article, we propose a declarative methodology to address the placement of FaaS applications onto Fog infrastructures, supported by a running prototype. Our methodology considers hardware and software requirements, and latency constraints on function- function and function-service interactions. Particular attention is given to information flow security constraints and trust relations among the involved stakeholders, to rank eligible output placements. A lifelike motivating example from augmented reality is used to showcase the prototype."
